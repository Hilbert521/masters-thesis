\section{State observer}
\label{cap:state_observer}

Design of the \textit{model predictive controller}, requires a knowledge about development of all system states. This is a different situation than in the case of previously used PID controller, when only the controlled state needs to be known. There are some situations and corresponding systems, where all states values are relatively easy to obtain, respectively they might be already measured for another reason than the control. For instance cosmic, aerospace or another vehicles, where the typical states are position and its derivatives. But if not all states can be measured or we do not want to measure them, the state observer needs to be implemented. The state observer is a dynamical system that simulated concurrently with the controlled system. It has the same number of inputs and it is controlled by the same actions as the real system. The order of the observer is the same as the order of the system. Its states are supposed to be observable and they should correspond to the real system's states.

\subsection{Open-loop observer}

Let us have an LTI system that needs to be observed (assuming $\textbf{C} = \textbf{I}$, $\textbf{D} = \mathbf{0}$ i.e. the output consists directly of all states and there is no direct transfer from the input to the output). The uncertainty in the model is covered by a random variable $\textbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, which is usually called a \emph{process noise}. The system description (\ref{eq:lti_state_space}) can be extended to

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x}_{[t+1]} = \textbf{A}\textbf{x}_{[t]} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}_{[t]} + \textbf{w}_{[t]}.
\label{eq:lti_for_observer}
\end{equation}

The open-loop observer can be constructed by setting up following system (\ref{eq:openloop_observer}), where $\textbf{\^x}$ denotes a vector of estimated state values. If $\textbf{w}$ has non zero-mean, $\textbf{\^x}$ drifts from $\textbf{x}$ since the process noise is integrated over time. Three distinct situations can happen during the execution of the observer:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{\^x}_{[t+1]} = \textbf{A}\textbf{\^x}_{[t]} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}_{[t]}
\label{eq:openloop_observer}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Estimated states track well corresponding system states. The system was identified perfectly and there is no need for feedback control in this situation.
\item Estimated states track well system states, but there is some drift during the time frame of the experiment. The feedback loop is required to provide zero-offset observation.
\item States estimated by the observer are completely out of scope of real system states which may suggest that the observer's model is wrong.
\end{itemize}

Open-loop estimations in chapter \ref{cap:system_identification} indicate that our model is satisfactory, but the open-loop estimator would not probably lead to precise control results.

\subsection{Closed-loop observer}

The open-loop observer can be basically corrected by closing a feedback loop around the system as follows

\begin{equation}
\textbf{\^x}_{[t+1]} = \textbf{A}\textbf{\^x}_{[t]} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}_{[t]} - \textbf{L}\left(\textbf{x}_{[t]} - \textbf{\^x}_{[t]}\right).
\label{eq:closed_loop_observer}
\end{equation}

There are methods of finding $\textbf{L}$ such that poles of the observer are desirably placed\footnote{Assuming the system can be converted to the \textit{controlled canonical form}}. One can utilize that placing poles of a state feedback is a dual problem for placing poles of the observer. Practically, a state feedback controller can be tuned using matrices $\textbf{A}^T, \textbf{B}^T$ to get $\textbf{L}^T$ for the observer, hence the duality.

\subsection{Kalman filter}
\label{cap:kalman_filter_theory}

In this thesis, the Kalman filter (KF) was implemented to estimate all states of the helicopter and to filter the measured data from sensors. The Kalman filter is variant of the closed-loop iterative estimator. If well tuned, it corrects a drift in estimated states. It is widely used not only as an observer but also for its great filtering capabilities. A hypothesis about estimated states takes form of a normal distribution with mean vector $\hat{\textbf{x}}$ and covariance matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$. It presumes a dynamical model in the form (\ref{eq:lti_for_observer}), where $\textbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is drawn from normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\textbf{0}, \textbf{R})$, $\textbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. Furthermore, we presume a linear sensor model

\begin{equation}
\textbf{\^z}_{[t]} = \textbf{P}\textbf{\^x}_{[t]} + \textbf{v}_{[t]},
\end{equation}
\\
where $\textbf{\^z}_{[t]} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the measurement vector, $\textbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ is a matrix that maps the state vector to the measurement and $\textbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the measurement noise which is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(\textbf{0}, \textbf{Q})$, $\textbf{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$. A real measurement $\textbf{z}_{[t]} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is modeled using the sensor model by adding a sample of the measurement noise to all estimated states and transforming it by \textbf{P} to a measurement vector. The filter updates a state vector $\textbf{\^x}_{[t]}$ and its covariance matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]}$ between iterations. The feedback withing the filter is then constructed using the inverse sensor model with the real measurement $\textbf{z}_{[t]}$.

\hline
& vector & covariance & mapping to \textbf{\^x} & mapping to \textbf{\^z}\\

measurement & \textbf{\^z} & \textbf{Q} & & \textbf{I}\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Overview of vectors and matrices used in Kalman filter.}
\label{tab:matrices_in_kalman}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Prediction phase}

There are two stages of the KF algorithm, which are shown in the block diagram in figure \ref{fig:kalman_diagram}. The first one is the \textit{prediction phase} (\ref{eq:kalman_prediction}) which can be easily related to the open-loop observer (\ref{eq:openloop_observer}). Here, the new state vector is estimated using the model (\ref{eq:lti_for_observer}), previous state $\textbf{\^x}_{[t-1]}$ and the input $\textbf{u}_{[t-1]}$. Its covariance $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]}$ is modified using the model and the process noise covariance $\textbf{R}$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\textbf{x}}_{[t]} &\leftarrow \textbf{A}\hat{\textbf{x}}_{[t-1]} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}_{[t-1]} \\
\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]} &\leftarrow \textbf{A}\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t-1]}\textbf{A}^{T} + \textbf{R}
\end{split}
\label{eq:kalman_prediction}
\end{equation}    

\subsubsection{Correction phase}
The second phase is the \textit{correction phase} (\ref{eq:kalman_correction}), where the state vector is updated using the measurement $\textbf{z}_{[t]}$. The covariance $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]}$ is again modified, but this time using the noise measurement covariance \textbf{Q}. Following assignment statements denote the correction phase of the Kalman filter

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\textbf{K}_{[t]} &\leftarrow \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]}\textbf{P}^{T}\left(\textbf{P}\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]}\textbf{P}^{T} + \textbf{Q}\right)^{-1}, \\
\hat{\textbf{x}}_{[t]} &\leftarrow \hat{\textbf{x}}_{[t]} + \textbf{K}_{[t]}\left(\textbf{z}_{[t]} - \textbf{P}\hat{\textbf{x}}_{[t]}\right), \\
\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]} &\leftarrow \left(\mathbf{I} - \textbf{K}_{[t]}\textbf{P}\right)\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{[t]},
\end{split}
\label{eq:kalman_correction}
\end{equation}
\\
where $\textbf{K}_{[t]}$ is the Kalman gain, $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix and \textbf{P} is the matrix that maps estimated states to the measurement. The first part consists of computing a Kalman gain $\textbf{K}_{[t]}$. It has a direct correspondence to the matrix \textbf{L} in (\ref{eq:closed_loop_observer}) thus it determines the feedback effect in the observer. The gain can be fine tuned by carefully setting \textbf{R} and \textbf{Q}. The \textbf{Q} can be found by observing the noise parameters of measurements. It means that the process noise can be independently set. The table \ref{tab:matrices_in_kalman} denotes the important vectors and matrices that are used in the filter. Practically there is a trade-off between trusting fully to the model and trusting fully to sensors. When setting \textbf{R} the filtered values have to be observed and the Kalman filter should be set basically by tuning the ratio between elements of \textbf{R} and \textbf{Q}. The desired outcome usually is to eliminate the measurement noise while still preserving the zero-offset tracking (with sufficient transient response) of all estimated states.

\subsection{Summary}

The Kalman filter was presented in order to estimate all system states and filter measured data. Its performance can be shown on subsequence of data (forward movement) used in chapter \ref{cap:attitude_subsystem_identification}. The figure \ref{fig:kalman1} shows the velocity of UAV measured by onboard sensor. Among others, it is able to estimate all other states including the position and the acceleration which is essential for further use of model predictive controller. It can be tuned to estimate noisy signal with relatively small delay compared to e.g. exponential filter\footnote{The exponential filter is a method where filtered values are computed as $\textbf{\^x}_{[t]} = \alpha\textbf{\^x}_{[t-1]} + (1-\alpha)\textbf{P}\textbf{z}_{[t]}$}. For particular parameters of KF that were used in the final implementation see chapter \ref{cap:Implementation} where also an extended form of LTI system is presented to provide a disturbance estimation. For an intuitive description of KF in more details see \citep{faragher2012understandingKF}.
