\section{State observer}

Implementing an advanced control mechanism such as \textit{linear quadratic controller}, \textit{full state feedback} or in our case, \textit{model predictive controller}, requires a knowledge of all system states. This is a different situation then in a case of previously used PID controller, when only the controlled state needs to be known. There are some situations and corresponding systems, where the knowledge of all states is relatively easy to reach, respectively it might be already measured for another reason. For instance space, aerials or another vehicles, where the typical states are position and its derivatives. But in the case where not all states can be measured or we do not want to measure them, the state observer needs to be implemented. The state observer is a dynamical system which is simulated concurrently with the controlled system. It has the same number of inputs and it is controlled by the same actions as the real system. The order of the observer is the same as the order of the system. Its states are supposed to be observable and should correspond to the real system's states.

\subsection{Open-loop observer}

Let us have an LTI system that needs to be observed (considering $\textbf{C} = \mathbb{I}$, $\textbf{D} = \mathbf{0}$)

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x} = \textbf{A}\textbf{x} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u} + \textbf{w}
\end{equation}

The Open-loop observer can be constructed by setting up a system

\begin{equation}
\textbf{\^x} = \textbf{A}\textbf{\^x} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}
\end{equation}

Following situations can be expected during the execution

\begin{itemize}
\item Estimated states track well corresponding system states. In this situation the system was identified perfectly and there is no need for feedback control.
\item Estimated states track well system sates, but there is some drift during the time frame of the experiment.
\item States estimated by the observer are completely out of scope of the system states which may suggest that the observer's model is wrong.
\end{itemize}

Open-loop estimations in chapter \ref{cap:system_identification} indicate that the model is in our case satisfactory but the Open-loop estimator would not probably lead to precise control results.

\subsection{Closed-loop observer}

The open-loop observer can be basically corrected by closing a feedback loop around the system.

\begin{equation}
\textbf{\^x} = \textbf{A}\textbf{\^x} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u} - \textbf{L}\left(\textbf{x} - \textbf{\^x}\right)
\label{eq:closed_loop_observer}
\end{equation}

There are methods of finding $\textbf{L}$ such that poles of the observer are properly placed\footnote{Assuming the system can be converted to the \textit{controlled canonical form}}. One can utilize that placing poles of a state feedback is a dual problem for placing poles of the observer.

\subsection{Kalman filter}

For the purpose of this Thesis, the Kalman filter was implemented to estimate all states of the helicopter and to filter the measured data from sensors. The Kalman filter is a closed-loop iterative estimator. A hypothesis about estimated states takes form of a normal distribution with mean vector $\hat{\textbf{x}}$ and covariance matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$. It presumes a model in a following form

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x}_{t+1} = \textbf{A}\textbf{x}_t + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}_t + \textbf{w}_t
\end{equation}

where \textbf{w} is a process noise vector. The noise is supposed to be drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution with a covariance matrix \textbf{R}. Further due there is a sensor model

\begin{equation}
\textbf{z}_t = \textbf{H}\textbf{x}_t + \textbf{v}_t
\end{equation}

where $\textbf{z}$ is a measurement vector, \textbf{H} is a matrix that maps the state vector to the measurement and $\textbf{v}$ is the measurement noise vector. The noise is again drawn from a normal distribution with a covariance matrix \textbf{Q}. The filter holds a state vector $\textbf{\^x}$ and its covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ between iterations. There are two phases of the Kalman filter algorithm. The first one is the \textit{prediction phase}, where the new state vector is estimated using only the model. Its covariance $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ is modified using a process noise covariance $\textbf{R}$. The second phase is the \textit{correction phase} when the state vector is updated using a measured data and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is again modified using the noise measurement covariance \textbf{P}.      

\subsubsection*{Prediction phase}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\textbf{x}}_t &\leftarrow \textbf{A}\hat{\textbf{x}}_{t-1} + \textbf{B}\textbf{u}_{t-1} \\
\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_t &\leftarrow \textbf{A}\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{t-1}\textbf{A}^{T} + \textbf{R}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The prediction phase can be easily compared to the open-loop observer. 

\subsubsection*{Correction phase}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\textbf{K}_t &\leftarrow \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_t\textbf{C}^{T}\left(\textbf{C}\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_t\textbf{C}^{T} + \textbf{Q}\right)^{-1} \\
\hat{\textbf{x}}_t &\leftarrow \hat{\textbf{x}}_t + \textbf{K}_t\left(\textbf{z}_t - \textbf{C}\hat{\textbf{x}}_t\right) \\
\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_t &\leftarrow \left(\mathbb{I} - \textbf{K}_t\textbf{C}\right)\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_t
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\textbf{K}_t$ is the Kalman gain, $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity matrix, \textbf{C} is the matrix that maps estimated states to the measurement.

The first part of the correction phase consists of computing a Kalman gain $\textbf{K}_t$. It has a direct correspondence to the matrix \textbf{L} in (\ref{eq:closed_loop_observer}) thus it determines the feedback effect in the observer. The gain can be fine tuned by carefully setting \textbf{R} and \textbf{P}. The \textbf{P} can be found by observing the noise parameters of measurements. That means the process noise is left for us to set. Practically there is a trade-off between trusting fully to the model and trusting fully to sensors. When setting \textbf{R} the filtered values have to be observed and the Kalman filter should be set basically by tuning the ratio between elements of \textbf{R} and \textbf{P}. The desired outcome usually is to eliminate the measurement noise while still preserving the zero-offset tracking (with sufficient transient response) of all estimated quantities.
