\section{Hardware and Software platform}
\label{cap:platform}

In order to test the embedded implementation of MPC on real aircraft, either an existing platform has to be used, or a new one created. Creating a custom hardware is a tedious job, but it is an investment that may repay itself by providing complete control over platform's parameters and design. The key decision has been done to improve the existing design of custom control board (see author's Bc. thesis \citep{baca2013} for more details) emphasizing possibility to reuse the code that has been already developed. A new version has been designed by incorporating experience and observations from prior development. Following chapter firstly describes the UAV testbed used for experimental validation of the control design, then there is the new control board presented with overview of its features and capabilities, and lastly the software structure is discussed including realtime operating system and custom matrix library used for UAV control.

\subsection{UAV platform}

The UAV is a custom built tricopter (fig. \ref{fig:tricopter}) with one propeller mounted on a tilting mechanism. It has a capability to pitch, roll and yaw just as any other multirotor UAV. The yaw control is supplied by the tilting mechanism while pitch and roll can be controlled by changing the ratio between rotational speed of all motors. All propellers are mounted directly on brushless motors, each one of them controlled by an individual ESC (electronic speed controller). The platform is capable of lifting payload of $150 \jed{g}$ while its weight is $450\jed{g}$. Its flight time is 7 minutes on average. Propellers are $5\times3.8 \jed{inch}$ in dimensions, mounted on motors by rubber bands to increase safety.

The aircraft is equipped with the \textit{KK2} board that provides the basic stabilization of pitch and roll angles ($\theta$, $\psi$) and yaw rate ($\dot{\phi}$). It is a low-cost ($\approx 30\jed{USD}$) commercial product with open-source software. It utilizes 3-axis MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers to estimate $\theta$, $\psi$, $\dot{\phi}$ and allow the vehicle to be controlled as an RC model. It incorporates a set of nested PID controllers for both attitude axis. They can be easily tuned using built-in display and buttons. It can handle various types of multirotor aircraft including the tricopter. Another important module is the \textit{px4flow} device, which is the only sensor used for localization of UAV 3D pose in space (see section \ref{cap:px4flow} for more information).

\subsection{px4flow sensor}
\label{cap:px4flow}

The vehicle is localized in 3D space by the \textit{px4flow} sensor \citep{px4flow, honegger2013open} (fig. \ref{fig:px4flow}), developed and produced by PixHawk \citep{pixhawk}. It encapsulates two sensors --- a camera for computing an optical flow and an ultrasonic rangefinder for measuring a distance from the ground. It provides an information about its velocity relative to the ground computed by the correlation of two consecutive images from the camera (the same principle as employed in most computer mice). The velocity is internally compensated from rotational motion by built-in gyroscope and finally scaled to absolute values using the altitude measured by the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor is able to measure velocities up to $0.5\jed{ms^{-1}}$ when flying in 1 meter altitude in good light conditions. The altitude is measured from $0.3\jed{m}$ to $4\jed{m}$. Data is sent in frequency around $70\jed{Hz}$ over UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) using MAVLink protocol \citep{px4flow}.

\subsection{Custom control board v.2}

The control board v.2 (see fig. \ref{fig:custom_board}) is a significant improvement of the previous version \citep{baca2013} that comprised only of a single 8-bit Atmel microcontroller. After 1 year of using the old control board, designed within Bc. thesis of author of this thesis, in research of Department of Cybernetics, CTU in Prague, following requirements initiated a development of the second version. The platform should support variety of connections for external sensors and modules, mainly via UART and $\mathrm{i}^2\mathrm{c}$. It should support onboard data logging that is necessary for debugging and capturing data for system identification. Another requirement is a presence of a telemetry module. The UAV should be able to send short packets of data to another helicopter and to the ground station (laptop). The main motivation is to allow simple telemetry data being displayed on laptop while conducting an experiment. This should limit the number of unsuccessful experiments by offering a simple way to detect misbehaving sensors etc. Additionally, was required a tool for sending simple commands from PC to the UAV. And the last and most important demand was to support execution of the model predictive controller, being the goal of this thesis.

The board itself was built upon a standard (for UAVs) square mounting pattern ($45\times 45\jed{mm}$). It is designed in such way that allows mounting another board with dimensions $50\times 50\jed{mm}$ on its top while not obscuring connectors, buttons and radio antenna. The board contains a $3.3\jed{V}, 1\jed{A}$ switching power supply that powers all its components. For an electrical schematic see Appendix~\ref{ape:schematic}, for layouts of the printed circuit board see Appendix~\ref{ape:pcb}. Following sections contain brief description of all key parts of the control board. Figure~\ref{fig:block_diagram_modules} shows a block diagram of all modules on the UAV.

\label{fig:custom_board}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{xMega main unit}

The first of two used microcontrollers is 8-bit AVR, ATxMega128a3u. It was decided to distribute software tasks (MPC, Kalman filter and others) onto two separate units. The controllers and estimators are isolated in the co-processing ARM microcontroller, allowing potential students to develop on xMega without worrying about damaging the control system. Another reason is to reuse the low-level code (communication handling) to be reused from the previous version of the control board. The xMega MCU (microcontroller unit) is designated for handling all communication and other minor tasks. It is one of the most powerful MCUs in AVR 8-bit family with $32 \jed{MHz}$ clock and $8 \jed{kB}$ of SRAM memory. One of its greatest features are 7 separate UARTs. 3 of them are used for communication with other onboard parts, 4 of them are left free for connecting external devices. One is equipped with an optional level converter for connecting $5 \jed{V}$ devices. Additionally, there are two $\mathrm{i}^2\mathrm{c}$ lines and PPM\footnote{Pulse position modulation is a communication protocol commonly used on UAVs and RC models.} input/output for communicating with \textit{KK2} and RC receiver (both with optional level converters). The software is developed using C programming language and uploaded to the microcontroller using a dedicated hardware programmer.

\subsubsection{ARM coprocessing unit}

The second MCU onboard is a powerful 32-bit ARM device produced by STMicroelectronics --- STM32F415RGT6. It is built upon ARM Cortex M4 with FPU (floating point unit) which allows a native work with floating point numbers. It has a powerful processor working on $168 \jed{MHz}$ accompanied by $192 \jed{kB}$ of RAM. This MCU is designated solely for computing Kalman filter and MPC. It is incorporated in such a way, that it only serves as an external coprocessor for xMega --- there are no peripherals connected to it. There are several reasons for choosing the architecture where the more powerful MCU does not serve for all purposes although it has enough resources for it. The first one is the backwards compatibility with previously developed software. The xMega can execute it without many changes. The second one is the fact that it is more complicated to develop on the ARM STM, than the simpler AVR xMega MCU (The system as a whole is designed withing this thesis as an open platform for another students to develop and test their work.). Since the MPC and Kalman filter are important pieces of the program and their unwanted modification could make the machine dangerous, it was decided to conserve it on a separate MCU. The controller and KF are then used from the xMega MCU by a form of API. Important feature of STM is its floating point unit. Custom benchmarks has shown that it is capable of making $\approx 6 \times 10^6$ floating point operations per second which is a noticeable  difference comparing it to the xMega's $\approx 3\times 10^4$.
\subsubsection{XBee telemetry module}

When searching for a suitable wireless communication module, one cannot miss the family of XBee devices \citep{xbee}. Built upon ZigBee standard, they can be set up to maintain one of several communication network topologies e.g. star or mesh. There are many different versions of XBee, based on its capabilities and frequency used. All of them support the same connection socket so they can be easily swapped for another type when necessary. Currently, we use XBee Pro S2B that works on $2.4\jed{GHz}$ ISM band. Practical tests shown that it is not well suited for any real-time critical data transfers since there is a significant delay ($\approx 150\jed{ms}$)  and its throughput is $\approx 20\jed{kbit/s}$. The XBee module is used to transmit telemetry data to the ground station and allows communication between multiple UAVs. The communication protocol was developed by another student within his Bc. thesis \citep{fiedler2015}.

\subsubsection{OpenLog data logging module}

Since we were not interested in creating our own data logger, we have integrated an existing, open source solution --- OpenLog \citep{openlog}. It has been designed to serve as an external SD card logging device connected by UART. Because its design is very simple, it was directly integrated into the control board. One can then set it up to receive a stream of data from the xMega MCU once the UAV is turned one. In our system, it handles logging $30\jed{bytes}$ with rate $70\jed{Hz}$ which is sufficient for debugging and system identification.

\subsection{FreeRTOS and tasks}

A program for MCU such as xMega and STM can be created in two ways. The most straightforward one is to develop the bare application that will be directly executed on the processor while utilizing all of its computational resources. It is up to the creator of the program to manage concurrent processes, interact with hardware and supply fast communication responses in parallel with long-running calculations. In previous work, the control software was developed exactly in this way. Its benefit is obvious. The programmer has a complete control over the hardware, since only his code is executed on the CPU. But when the application gets complicated, an operating system can be used to take care of allocating computational resources for different parts of the program. There is a family of operating systems intended for real-time applications called Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). 

The reader should not confuse the RTOS with the notion of operating system usually used on personal computers. RTOS are special software solutions developed with different criteria. The main one is its scheduling which ensures that each application is given its time slot in a deterministic and defined time. The scheduling usually works based on hardware timers and interrupts. Context switch in RTOS is usually very fast and it happens relatively often to allow real-time processing of incoming data. One of widely used RTOS is the FreeRTOS \citep{freertos}. An Open Source solution with existing ports for both MCUs used in the control board. It offers a capability to create so called \textit{tasks}, an analogy of processes in classical operating systems. Tasks are separate pieces of program with its own CPU context and memory stack. 

The RTOS takes care of switching between tasks based on given priority allowing user to develop apparently multitask application. There are new issues coming up with this concept, which are the problems of synchronization and sharing resources. The FreeRTOS incorporates \textit{queues} and \textit{semaphores} which are supposed to be used for exchanging data between tasks and for their synchronization. We have incorporated the FreeRTOS on both MCUs creating separate tasks for handling communication and computations. See figure \ref{fig:block_diagram_uav} for view on tasks and the information flow between them.

Since our system requires execution of controllers and estimators in order of tens\jed{Hz} and it has to handle communication in rate in order of hundreds\jed{Hz}, the context switch rate was chosen in order of magnitude faster --- $1000\jed{Hz}$. But still some operations require even faster execution and reaction times (e.g. reception and creation of pulse-position signal or buffering raw data from peripherals). That is why a part of the control software remains executed directly on interrupt basis, independently of the FreeRTOS. Due to safety constraints, the system is able to hand over the UAV to the human operator even when the FreeRTOS and the control system do not work properly or even freezes. Both implementations on our MCUs require around $4\jed{kB}$ which leaves around 4\jed{kB} for our code.

\subsection{Tasks on xMega MCU}

The software on xMega consists of 4 different tasks running equally in parallel. \emph{CommTask} is designated to handle incoming and outgoing communication. Since shared access to all communication media would be difficult to maintain, all other tasks communicate with peripherals via the CommTask. \emph{ControllersTask} handles computations with regards to system controllers. \emph{LogTask} is responsible for periodic data logging to OpenLog module. Finally, \emph{MainTask}, despite its name, handles minor jobs as trajectory following and flight state automaton (modeling different flight modes of the UAV). 

\subsection{Tasks on STM MCU}

Tasks on STM have much clearer designation. There is also \emph{CommTask} serving as a communication mediator. The second one is \emph{KalmanTask} which handles complete computation of the Kalman filter. Finally, \emph{MPCTask}, which takes care of computing the model predictive controller.

\subsection{CMatrixLib - ANSI C matrix library}

Implementation of the Kalman filter (section \ref{cap:kalman_filter_theory}) and the model predictive controller (section \ref{cap:mpc_theory}) requires to deal mainly with vector and matrix operations. Although they can be implemented directly using the programming language, this way is impractical for code debugging and it discards the clarity of mathematical matrix notation. There is a large selection of matrix libraries \citep{matrixlibraries} available for variety of programming languages. But since both software for STM and xMega are developed using ANSI C programming language and our platforms are specific (the architectures of these processors are specific, thus the library should be supplied by means of its source code) we decided to develop our own matrix library. Another reason that supports this decision is to maintain as much control over the executed code as possible, especially with regards to memory allocation, which is a critical issue for microcontrollers (and considering we are dealing with matrices and vectors with dimensions in order of hundreds). Our library supports basic matrix and vector operations with floating point values as well as basic algebra operators, such as matrix inversion and computation of determinant. It was developed with intention to minimize memory stack footprint by requiring prior memory allocation for subresults. There is also a possibility to create a matrix using a constant data located within the program memory. CMatrixLib, as we named it, is released on a community website GitHub \citep{cmatrixlib} under GNU General Public License together with a proper documentation.

\subsection{Summary}

This section described the platform used for development, testing and evaluation of model predictive controller onboard the UAV. The aircraft uses a classical tricopter design utilizing built-in stabilization board. We proposed a custom control board for handling signal processing and controller computation onboard while supplying wireless telemetry and data logging. Two different microcontrollers were used to allow a decomposition of the cod. Computationally intensive tasks (Kalman filter and MPC) are located on 32-bit ARM coprocessor, while communication and other tasks are left on 8-bit xMega MCU. Both systems utilize FreeRTOS, Real-Time operating system. RTOS Tasks were presented with brief description of their purpose. In order to implement KF and MPC on these microcontrollers, a CMatrixLib matrix library was developed and published as an Open Source project on community website \url{https://github.com/klaxalk/CMatrixLib}.
