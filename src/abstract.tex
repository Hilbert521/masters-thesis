This thesis deals with autonomous stabilization of unmanned multirotor aircraft along predefined trajectories, using a model predictive control approach. The main focus of this work lies in design and implementation of an embedded platform to allow onboard execution of the controller. We propose a linear dynamical model of the helicopter, identification of its parameter and design of a state observer. A quadratic model predictive controller is derived, implemented, and prepared for the experimental platform, which has been created for this purpose. Presented experiments, conducted both indoors and outdoors, verified the capability of the system to accurately follow a desired trajectory in space.
