This thesis deals with automatic control of unmanned multirotor aircraft using a model predictive control approach. The focus is on design and implementation of an embedded platform to allow onboard execution of the controller. We propose a model of a dynamical system, identification of its parameter and design of a state observer. A quadratic model predictive controller is derived and implemented into the hardware, created for this purpose. Presented experiments, conducted both indoors and outdoors, proved system's capability to accurately follow a desired trajectory in space.
